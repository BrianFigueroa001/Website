            I'm an undergraduate living in Miami, Florida. I have associate's in Computer Science at

            in Computer Science as well.<br><br>

            I've been working in and outside of my classes to develop the skills needed to become a successful
            full-stack software engineer. While there are many areas that I find interesting and hope to explore in the
            future, my current areas of focus have been on web development and cloud computing. <br><br>

            Software Development Engineer Intern
            June 2020 - August 2020
        </header>
         I had the opportunity to spend 10 weeks working for Zillow and get exposed to the industry.<br><br>

         I learned many new skills, both technical and non-technical, and got exposed to what it's like to work
         in an environment that implements Agile practices. This involved daily stand-ups, bi-weekly sprint planning/demo/retrospectives,
         and using Jira for Kanban with my team.<br><br>
         Accomplishments:

        <ul id="zgAccomplishments">
            <li>
                I provided application performance monitoring (APM) features for some of ZG's micro-services using
                Datadog's APM platform and their APIs.<br><br>
                I integrated Datadog into our micro-services by creating bash scripts and implementing GitLab's pipeline functionality
                to automate the creation and maintenance of Datadog's dashboards and monitoring features.<br><br>

                This gave the team I was with transparency on the health and performance of their micro-services
                while automating a lot of the work they would need to do otherwise to maintain Datadog features.

                This was my main project that lasted from the second week of my internship to the end.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                I coordinated with UI/UX and DevOps teams to include a new feature in our service that will allow automatic,
                hands-off sending of emails to recipients based on triggered events.<br><br>

                I synchronized with a different team who are are responsible for maintaining their service that's used
                to automate the process of sending emails.<br><br>

                This involved learning quickly about their service in order to
                create email templates (written HTML) and modify configuration files (HOCON) as needed to integrate
                my team's service with theirs.<br><br>

                For my team's service, I wrote Java code to extract data from JSON files, fetched from GraphQL, which are
                used to populate placeholders in the email templates with personalized information relating to the recipient
                before sending an email out.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                I participated in a company-wide hack-week with my team to develop a dynamic website that provides non-technical
                admins a web-interface to view and manage sensitive information stored in MySQL and DynamoDB databases.
                <br><br>
                I designed and developed a web-page, and this involved using React for the first time. Since we only had
                two days to work on the project, I quickly learned how to use the React framework along the
                way.<br><br>

                I recycled an existing react component and modified as needed to satisfy the new requirements.
                This involved writing code (JavaScript) to create listeners and event handlers, based on user events,
                that executes HTTP requests for existing services that were responsible for querying the databases in
                order to acquire or manipulate data. <br><br>

                This also involved coordinating with the team to determine what data to expose to the user and
                designing the interface itself in a user-friendly format.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                I performed other trivial tasks to help me learn more about micro-services architecture and
                CI/CD practices including:
                <ul>
                     <li>
                         Supporting deployment of several micro-services from development to stage environments.
                     </li>
                    <li>
                        Wrote missing unit tests on existing code with JUnit 5 to achieve 100% test coverage.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

            Programming Instructor Intern<br>
            January 2019 - August 2019
        </header>

        I had the opportunity to teach kids from ages 13 and below about 4th generation technology and basic
        programming fundamentals for the summer of 2019.

        Some of the subjects taught include mobile and 3D game development, minecraft artificial intelligence, and
        virtual reality. <br><br>

        I gave my students a head start on understanding core programming concepts
        such as variables, functions, conditional logic, object-oriented programming principles, and data structures.

        </header>
        I worked and continue to work as a part time student assistant for a Junior-level programming course.
        My duty is to evaluate and grade programs written in Java.<br><br>
        I inspect and evaluate their code visually and carefully for correct functionality, readability, and quality. <br><br>
        I'm also responsible for spotting and assessing signs of plagiarism, such as finding nigh-identical code across multiple submissions,
        and communicating my concerns with the professor.<br><br>
        After assignments are graded and submitted, I also take the additional step to provide feedback to help students
        improve, going as far as to debug their code if they couldn't find the bug themselves.
