				I'm currently an intern at Code Explorers since Spring 2019.<br>
				I teach pre-university students about various technologies<br>
				such as robotic and coding. It's my job to enable the next generation
				of students for their future in computer science and engineering!
				<br><br>
				Check out their website: <a href="https://www.codeexplorers.org/">www.codeexplorers.org</a>		
				<br><br>
				I'm also developing another comprehensive website for my friend. She's an amazing artist who wants a place
				to host her artwork and show off her products! This will be one of my projects for the Summer of 2019.
