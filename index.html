				My name is Brian Figueroa. I'm student at Florida International University and an aspiring Software Engineer.
				You're visiting my portfolio website which is where I'll talk about myself and provide links to my
				programming projects.

				I'm currently an intern at Code Explorers since Spring 2019.
				I have the opportunity to teach pre-university students about various technologies
				such as robotic and coding. It's my job to enable the next generation
				of students for their future in computer science and engineering!<br>

					Summer 2018 Data Structures
				</header>

				I learned about data structures ahead of my classes in the Summer of 2018 since they are a very important concept. The following lists some of my 
				favorite toy programs that I made to help me learn:<br><br>

				<b>Stacks Infix Calculator:</b>  This calculator can evaluate simple arithmetic expressions in infix notation. The stack is used to enforce the order of operations as the program reads the string containing the expression.<br>

				<b>RPG Character Table:</b> I explored hash tables by using one to store RPG character objects and their information. Access to each character is granted via a password that's used as the hash key. I used linear probing as my collision resolution.<br>

				My first JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5 website! It reads user input and converts it to robot speech. It integrates JavaScript's Web Speech API to read the text out loud. Click on the picture to check it out!

						Code Explorers Internship
					</header>
					I was given the opportunity to teach kids from ages 13 and below about 4th generation technology and basic programming for the summer of 2019. Some of the subjects taught include mobile and 3D game development and Virtual and Augmuented reality. <br><br>

					While most of the coding consisted of block programming, I was able to get my students a headstart on understanding core concepts such as variables, functions, conditional logic, object-oriented programming principles, and even a little bit of data structures.
